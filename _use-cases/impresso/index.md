The [Impresso][1] project aims to enable critical text mining of newspaper archives with the 
implementation of a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from print 
media archives.

The project works with a large corpus of historical newspapers data in several languages: 
mainly French and German, but also Luxembourgish; historical period: from end of 18th century to the
present time (see [state of newspaper collection][2]).

To achieve this aim, several NLP techniques are employed, including:

* Named entity processing (classification and disambiguation/linking)
* NE recognition and classification: custom tag set, based on [Quaero annotation guidelines][3]
* NE linking: against Wikidata and an internal KB

Due to the special nature of the text corpus, off-the-shelve models cannot be used for the above tasks.
For this reason, INCEpTION will be used as the annotation environment for an extensive annotation
campaign (running August 2018 -> June 2019). We will use it for annotating NE-related information
in our data, either from scratch or with pre-annotated annotations.

Features that we consider of particular importance to our use-case are:

* import structured stand-off annotations generated by Python code via [Cassis][4]
* linking with KB: to note here the necessity for INCEpTION's functionalities to scale up to e.g. 
  Wikidata-sized resources, with tens of thousands of class instances
* active learning will be used to speed up the annotation process
* monitoring, to follow the annotators' progress
* inter-annotator agreement

(desideratum): ability to store and display document metadata; in impresso it's crucial to provide the annotator with a link to the IIIF page image to which the document being annotated belongs
