    title: Towards an Infrastructure for the Distributed Exploration and Annotation of Large Corpora and Knowledge Bases
    text: INCEpTION provides a semantic annotation platform offering intelligent annotation assistance and knowledge management.
---

The annotation of specific semantic phenomena often require compiling task-specific corpora and
creating or extending task-specific knowledge bases. Presently, researchers require a broad range
of skills and tools to address such semantic annotation tasks.

In the recently funded INCEpTION project, UKP Lab at TU Darmstadt aims towards building an 
annotation platform that incorporates all the related tasks into a joint web-based platform.
